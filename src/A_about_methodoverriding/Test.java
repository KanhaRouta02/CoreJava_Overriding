//  Method Overriding
//  ------------------
//  -> Having same method name with same argument is called Method Overriding.
//  -> It is the process of providing subclass specific method implementation for an
//     inherited method.
//  -> If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared 
//     by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.   
//  -> Method overriding is possible only in case of Inheritance.
//  
//  Usage of Java Method Overriding
//  -------------------------------
//  o Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is
//    already provided by its superclass.
//  o Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism.
//  
//  Rules for Method overriding
//  ----------------------------
//  => The return type of method must be same as declared in super class.
//  => Method name must be same as declared in super class.
//  => Signature must be same as declared as in super class. Logic can be different.
//  => Non-static method should be overridden but not static method.
//  => W.R.T Access modifier we can write same or we can increase the scope.
